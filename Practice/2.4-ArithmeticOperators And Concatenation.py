# Arithmetic Operators
# Addition(+): Adds two operands. For example, 5 + 3 results in 8
# Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first. For example, 5 - 3 results in 2.
# Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands. For example, 5 * 3 results in 15.
# Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second. For example, 5 / 3 results in approximately 1.67.
# Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of two operands. For example, 5 % 3 results in 2.
# Exponentiation (∗∗): Raises the first value to the power of the second. For instance, 10 ** 2 equals 100.
# Floor Division (//): Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer. For example, 10 // 3 gives 3.
